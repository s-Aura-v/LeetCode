Could not solve

Main Problems:
1. Could not turn int back to char
[ 0 - > a, 1 -> b, ..., 26 -> z)
Solution:
Use ASCII / Char Values
a = 97, so finding the int value then adding 97 would help you get the char

2. Moving the substring by a value of 2
If abcd, after I did ab, I had a problem skipping b then going to c
Solution:
In the for loop, add by k instead of adding by 1.
for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i+=k)

Lesson
1. Instead of converting char to int and int to char, it might be easier to just use 'a' and use an operation
i + 'a'
vs
int x = i + 97;
